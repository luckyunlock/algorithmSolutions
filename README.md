## About the repo

The repo is a bucket containing personal solutions to common algoritmical problems.

## Structure

Every problem is stored in a dedicated file inside a topic directory (list, BST, Stack, Graphs, etc.)
Inside the file, the problem and a theorical solution are stated. The implementation follows as long as few test cases that makes the scripts runnable.

# Getting started
